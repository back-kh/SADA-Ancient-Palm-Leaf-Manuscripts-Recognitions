## Paper 1: KH-SADA ‚Äì Khmer Syllable Analysis Data Augmentation

### üß† Introduction

This project introduces a glyph dictionary and grammar-aware augmentation strategy designed to enhance Khmer palm leaf manuscript recognition. By modeling the language's grammatical structure, we support more robust OCR performance in low-resource settings.

### üóÇÔ∏è Background

Inspired by publicly available datasets from the ICFHR 2018 competition, we built this dictionary to capture essential grammar forms of Khmer syllables. This linguistic grounding is critical for generating valid word formations and improving recognition accuracy.

### üì¶ Repository Contents

- **Khmer Grammar Structures**  
  Core grammar forms (CV, CVC, etc.) used in valid word formations.

- **Glyph Classes & Types**  
  Categorized glyphs (e.g., base consonants, subscripts, vowels) to facilitate structured augmentation.

- **Ground Truth Training Data**  
  Labeled glyph image dataset used for training and evaluation.

- **Latin Transliterated Dictionary**  
  Mapping of Khmer glyphs to Latin script for cross-linguistic comparison.

- **Baseline Recognition System (DenseNet + GRU)**  
  Implementation and results of our ICFHR 2018-winning model using DenseNet and GRU.

### üîÅ Syllable-Based Augmentation

Our augmentation module simulates realistic glyph combinations using grammar constraints. It improves model generalization by introducing diverse and syntactically valid examples.

### üîç Recognition Results

We use attention-based visualization to inspect how the model interprets each glyph, helping identify strengths and failure points in OCR output.

##  Paper 2: PALM-SADA ‚Äì Multi-Low Resource Languages Syllable Analysis Data Augmentation

> **Status:** Under review at *Pattern Recognition Letters*

This paper extends our work from KH-SADA to **multi-script analysis**, including **Khmer, Balinese, and Sundanese**. It introduces a grammar-aware augmentation framework for multi-script palm leaf manuscripts and an improved recognition architecture.

PALM-SADA presents a unified grammar-aware data augmentation and error analysis framework for palm leaf manuscript recognition, targeting low-resource Southeast Asian scripts. This project builds on our previous KH-SADA work for Khmer, now extending to multi-script analysis with Khmer, Balinese, and Sundanese.


**PALM-SADA** introduces a grammar-aware data augmentation and error analysis framework for palm leaf manuscript recognition, focusing on **low-resource Southeast Asian scripts**. This work extends our previous KH-SADA project for Khmer to **multi-script analysis**, covering **Khmer, Balinese, and Sundanese**.

PALM-SADA fuses linguistic rules with deep learning architectures to improve recognition accuracy and provide in-depth error analysis for underrepresented scripts.

## Conclusion

This glyph dictionary serves as a foundational resource for researchers and developers working on text recognition in low-resource scripts. By integrating grammatical structures and providing a rich, linguistically-informed dataset, we aim to support the advancement of Khmer palm leaf manuscript recognition.

We welcome feedback, collaboration, and contributions to further enhance the tools and resources available for historical text recognition and classification. Thank you for your interest and support!
